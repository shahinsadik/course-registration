Create a Fake JSON File: It seems like you need to integrate data into your project. Creating a fake JSON file is a common practice during development to simulate real data. You can use this JSON file for testing and development purposes until you integrate real data sources.

Complete the Project: Continue working on your project, following the design and functionality requirements outlined in the assignment and Figma project file. Make sure to meet the project's objectives and adhere to any guidelines provided.

Review Line by Line: After completing the project, it's an excellent practice to review your code thoroughly.
